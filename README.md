# Generate adaptive treatment artificial data
Inspired by  [dynamic treatment regime (DTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_treatment_regime) or adaptive treatment strategy, the linear association (causal relationship) in the artificial data are created, as shown by causal diagram in the following figure.

and described in the following logic. Here, the first goal of modeling is to capture the closest to true causal features. Let 𝑋𝑂 denote covariates associated with outcome, 𝑋𝑂𝑇 predictors of both as confounders, 𝑋𝑇 the predictors of exposure (treatment), and finally 𝑋𝑆 nuisance or spurious covariates. All the covariates are correlated with a designated correlation matrix and generated by a modified version of the BinNor package in R. Later on, we describe the correlation structure in detail. The probability of each binary treatment is calculated by linear association with some selection of 𝑋𝑂𝑇, 𝑋𝑇, the past treatments and the previous outcome by Eq
